Introduction - Toronto is consistently named as one of the top worldwide cities for livability, quality of life, scenery, and multiculturalism. Toronto has a wide choice of restaurants. Being a city with vibrant colours one can only expect to find cuisines from all around the world. How does one know where to place another ethnic restaurant? To avoid being in close proximity to the similar cuisine, we will use data analysis and machine learning to find the optimal location for a Eritrean/Ethiopian restaurant in the Toronto area.

Target Audience - The project is beneficial for anyone who is looking to open an Eritrean/Ethiopian restaurant in the Toronto area. The audience can be franchisors or small business owners. The project can also benefit already running restaurants to shift to a better area for their type of restaurant.

Business Problem - The main objective of this project is to analyze the restaurant chains in the Toronto area by neighbourhood. The other objective of the project is to pay special attention to the types of cuisines available in the city and to avoid placing it too close. In abstract, the project aims to analyze the restaurants and the best location for opening a restaurant.

Data - Here are some factors influencing our project: number of existing Eritrean/Ethiopian cuisine restaurants per neighborhood, number of restaurants per neighborhood, type of cuisines. We will use foursquare api to find the venues in Toronto. Geopy will allow us to determine their coordinates in latitudes and longitudes.
